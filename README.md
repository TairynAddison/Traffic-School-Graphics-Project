# Traffic-School-Graphics-Project
The game "Tai's Traffic School" is a small and simple WebGl and Threejs demonstration.
________________________________________________________________
"Tai's Traffic School" is a small endless game where the player controls
a car and must avoid the traffic cones.

Controls: WASD

Version 1: 
    In this iteration:
        -Cones come continously
        -Cone groups prone to creep: increasing gap grows between
            the two groups with increasing overlap. Side effect of Group 2 behavior
        -Cones are randomized at start of game, but do not re-randomize currently.
            Pattern not "super" obvious for demonstration, but may be noticed if ran
            for extended time.
        -Road "moves" fine.

    Ver 1 To-Do List:
        -Collison
        -color or signal to player on collision
        -fix or re-write cone generation method ("theLot2" group 2 fix/investigate)
        
        Optional:
        -scenery
        -textures
        -smoother car movement
